## Introduction

Python Library to solve stochiometric equations.

Project to learn implementation of solvers and using optimisation to solve problems iteratively which otherwise would
take a long time to solve.

# Note

Advanced solvers already exists!! It is free and completely open source. Hope you enjoy it!!
